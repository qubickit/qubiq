description: Practical guidance for embedding @qubickit/core inside your own libraries and apps.
---

This library targets developers building SDKs, CLIs, bots, or dashboards on top of Qubic. Below are recommended patterns so you can integrate quickly and safely.

## Prefer high-level wrappers

- Use `QubicNodeClient` unless you explicitly need raw HTTP clients.
- When gRPC endpoints become public, re-use `live_service.proto` instead of rolling your own serialization.
- Wrap automation runtime profiles when building bots to avoid duplicating scheduling logic.

## Validate inputs early

- Leverage the exported Zod schemas (e.g., `ProposalDataSchema`, `TransactionSchema`) to validate user input before hitting the network.
- Use TSDoc to document parameter expectations; pull those into docs-web for clarity.

## Isolate secrets

- Store seeds via `encryptSecret`/`decryptSecret` and zeroize buffers after use.
- Keep `QUBIC_SEED` outside your codebase; inject via env vars or secret stores.

## Instrument everything

- Use `instrumentRequest` + `TelemetryMetricsRegistry` so you capture latency/error metrics for every RPC.
- Combine with the Prometheus server example to expose `/metrics` for dashboards.

## Test deterministically

- Mock services with `MockLiveServiceClient` in unit tests.
- Replay snapshot fixtures in CI to simulate busy ticks.
- Gate smoke tests behind `QUBIC_SMOKE_TESTS=true` to avoid flaky builds.

## Extend responsibly

- When building `@qubickit/sdk`, `@qubickit/cli`, or other downstream packages, depend on `@qubickit/core` types so you inherit schema updates automatically.
- For custom modules, export factory functions instead of mutating singletons; this keeps state predictable when users embed multiple instances.

## Document as you go

- Use this docs-web app (Fumadocs) to write MDX guides alongside code.
- Import `.source` metadata to render type references and search indexes (`docs-web/lib/source.ts`).
- Keep release notes (`docs/release-notes.md`) and compliance files (LICENSE/NOTICE) updated so adopters know what’s included.
