title: Utilities & Helpers
description: Small but sharp helpers exported for downstream SDKs.

Most tooling lives in dedicated modules (wallets, automation, proposals), but a few shared utilities sit under `@nexakit/core/utils`. Use them directly instead of rolling your own — they already follow the constraints enforced by the native node.

## Byte helpers

```ts
import { hexToBytes, bytesToHex, concatBytes } from "@nexakit/core/utils";

const bytes = hexToBytes("ab".repeat(32));
const hex = bytesToHex(bytes);
const merged = concatBytes(bytes, bytes);
```

- Verifies even-length hex strings and throws when invalid.
- Zero-copy concatenation reduces allocations when building headers or payloads.

## Numeric helpers

While most numeric utilities live inside higher-level modules, we intentionally keep BigInt arithmetic inside helpers like transaction serializers. Reuse them whenever possible to stay consistent with byte-order expectations (`little-endian` for amounts/ticks).

## Re-exports

Many modules (wallet signing, serialization, proposals) re-export these helpers so you rarely import from `@nexakit/core/utils` directly. Still, this module is public API, so don’t hesitate to rely on it for low-level work such as custom contract encoders, CLI inspectors, or hardware wallet adapters.
