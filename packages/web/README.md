# QubiQ Web Components (WIP)

This package will host framework-agnostic web helpers for the QubiQ ecosystem—React components, hooks, and utilities that build on the `@qubiq/core` runtime. For now it is a placeholder so downstream apps can begin depending on the workspace. Contributions that explore shared UI primitives are welcome.
