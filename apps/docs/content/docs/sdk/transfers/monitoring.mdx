# Monitoring transfers

Combine the automation event bus with transfer helpers to emit alerts when transfers are delayed.

## Prometheus metrics

```ts
await sendTransfer(wallet, liveClient, request, guardrails);
metrics.transfer_total.inc({ destination: request.destination });
```

Record latency per transfer (signing time + broadcast response) and export it via the metrics registry described in the core docs.

## Tick drift checks

```ts
const { tickInfo } = await liveClient.getTickInfo();
const tick = await prepareSignedTransfer(wallet, liveClient, request, guardrails);
if (tick.tick - (tickInfo.tick ?? 0) > guardrails.maxTickOffset) {
  console.warn("tick drift", { tick: tick.tick, latest: tickInfo.tick });
}
```

The guardrail ensures signatures stay within the allowed offset, but adding an external check helps you detect stuck nodes or slow pipelines.
