# Batching strategies

`sendTransferBatch` executes transfers sequentially. Combine it with queues, retries, and guardrails to handle mass payouts.

## Idempotent batches

```ts
const responses = await sendTransferBatch(wallet, liveClient, jobs, guardrails);
responses.forEach((response, index) => {
  console.log(jobs[index], response.status);
});
```

Wrap each batch in a job ID and log the response so you can re-run the batch if a worker crashes.

## Retry on throttling

```ts
for (const job of jobs) {
  await retry(async () => sendTransfer(wallet, liveClient, job, guardrails));
}
```

Use exponential backoff when the live service responds with `429` or `503`. Because each transfer is signed individually, retries are safe as long as you handle duplicates on the receiving side.
