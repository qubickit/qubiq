# Transfer helpers

`@qubiq/sdk/transfers` exposes three primitives:

```ts
import {
  prepareSignedTransfer,
  sendTransfer,
  sendTransferBatch,
} from "@qubiq/sdk";
```

All helpers accept a `Wallet`, a `LiveServiceClient` instance, and an optional `GuardrailConfig` produced by `resolveWallet`.

## prepareSignedTransfer

Returns a `SignedTransfer` without broadcasting it. Useful for offline signing or bundling:

```ts
const signed = await prepareSignedTransfer(wallet, liveClient, {
  destination: "SUZ...",
  amount: 1_000_000n,
  payload: new TextEncoder().encode("memo"),
  inputType: 1,
});
```

Pass `tick` to hardcode the exact tick or `tickOffset` to override the guardrail default. Supplying `payload` lets you embed contract invocations or metadata; when omitted, it defaults to an empty buffer.

## sendTransfer

Signs and immediately broadcasts via `liveClient.broadcastTransaction`. The helper converts bytes to Base64 automatically.

```ts
await sendTransfer(wallet, liveClient, {
  destination: "SUZ...",
  amount: 250_000n,
});
```

## sendTransferBatch

Sequentially signs + broadcasts each entry in the array, returning the `BroadcastTransactionResponse[]`. Combine with queues or cron jobs when working through payouts.

```ts
await sendTransferBatch(wallet, liveClient, [
  { destination: "SUZ...1", amount: 500_000n },
  { destination: "SUZ...2", amount: 250_000n, payload: Buffer.from("a1b2", "hex") },
]);
```

Each transfer executes sequentially to preserve nonce order and to make retry logic predictable. Wrap the call in a try/catch block to surface partial failures.

## Guardrails & ticks

Tick offsets are computed automatically using the guardrails provided by `resolveWallet`. If you pass `tick` explicitly, the helpers will respect it; otherwise they clamp the offset to `minTickOffset` / `maxTickOffset`. This prevents accidentally signing stale transactions when the live service is under load.

Use the same guardrail object everywhere to ensure automation jobs, batch senders, and interactive scripts all align.
