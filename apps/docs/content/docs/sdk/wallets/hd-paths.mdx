# HD path recipes

`resolveWallet` and `createWalletTools` accept any HD path because they reuse the FourQ derivation logic from `@qubiq/core`. Below are a few patterns you can adapt:

## App-specific accounts

```ts
await resolveWallet({
  seed: process.env.QUBIQ_SEED,
  hdPath: "m/44'/609'/0'/0/0",
});
```

Use the final index (`.../0`) to represent different apps or services. Keep a naming scheme documented so you can reproduce wallets later.

## Custody rotation

```ts
const rotationPath = `m/44'/609'/${rotationIndex}'/0/0`;
const wallet = await resolveWallet({ seed, hdPath: rotationPath });
```

Increment `rotationIndex` whenever you rotate custody or issue new payouts.

## Derived wallets via WalletTools

```ts
const tools = createWalletTools(await resolveWallet({ seed }));
const hotWallet = await tools?.derivePath("m/44'/609'/0'/1/0");
```

`derivePath` is useful when you need to keep the root seed in memory but still issue short-lived wallets for automation workers.
