# Contract introspection

`createContractToolkit().list()` returns every contract definition extracted from Qubic's headers.

```ts
const toolkit = createContractToolkit();
const definitions = toolkit.list();
definitions.forEach((definition) => {
  console.log(definition.name, definition.functions.map((fn) => fn.name));
});
```

Use the metadata to build documentation, auto-generate forms, or drive IDE completion. Each function includes the struct names for inputs/outputs, so you can feed them into `encodeStruct` or `decodeStruct` automatically.
