# Offline payloads

Use the encoder utilities to produce determinstic payloads for later use.

```ts
const proposalCall = encodeStruct("ComputorControlledFund_SetProposal_input", {
  epoch: 200,
  type: 0x100,
  proposal: {
    transfer: {
      destination: "SUZ...",
      amount: 100_000_000n,
    },
  },
});
await fs.writeFile("./payloads/proposal.bin", proposalCall);
```

Later, build an unsigned transaction that includes the payload. This is useful when auditors or governance participants need to review the proposal bytes before broadcasting.
