# QubiQ SDK

The SDK bundles high-level building blocks on top of `@qubiq/core` so dApp teams do not need to wire low-level payloads or tick math. At a glance it provides:

- Wallet orchestration with guardrails, AES-GCM storage helpers, and HD derivation.
- Transfer helpers that accept any `Wallet` + `LiveServiceClient` pair.
- A contract toolkit that reads the generated struct metadata and builds encoded payloads + query helpers.
- A proposal toolkit focused on the CCF contract for governance dashboards.
- Automation utilities (event bus + runtime wiring) that integrate with the core polling jobs.

> All functionality is exported from the package root, so you can either call `createQubiQSdk` for a batteries-included experience or cherry-pick the helpers you need for a CLI, service worker, or UI application.

```ts
import {
  resolveWallet,
  prepareSignedTransfer,
  sendTransfer,
  loadQubiQSdkConfig,
  createContractToolkit,
  createProposalToolkit,
} from "@qubiq/sdk";

const walletResolution = await resolveWallet({ seed: process.env.QUBIQ_SEED });
const liveClient = sdk.clients.live;

await sendTransfer(walletResolution.wallet, liveClient, {
  destination: "SUZ...",
  amount: 125_000n,
});

const contractToolkit = createContractToolkit({ client: liveClient });
const ccf = contractToolkit.use("ComputorControlledFund");
const { decoded } = await ccf.functions.GetProposal.call({ proposalIndex: 1 });

const sdk = await createQubiQSdk(
  await loadQubiQSdkConfig("./qubiq.config.json")
);
```

Need declarative setup? The configuration helpers understand `${ENV:VAR}` placeholders, instantiate webhooks, and merge overrides, so you can describe the entire runtime in JSON and feed it directly into `createQubiQSdk`.

Each module below dives deeper into the API surface.
