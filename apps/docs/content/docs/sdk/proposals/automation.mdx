# Automation hooks

Pair the proposal toolkit with the automation event bus to trigger scripts when proposals change status.

```ts
const proposals = createProposalToolkit(liveClient);

runtimeOptions: {
  onProposals: async (result) => {
    const summaries = proposals.summarize(result.proposals);
    await sendWebhook({ summaries });
  },
}
```

This pattern avoids refetching CCF data inside your handler; the automation runtime already provides the latest result.
