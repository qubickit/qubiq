# Proposal toolkit

`createProposalToolkit` wraps the CCF-specific helper from `@qubiq/core` and exposes filtered results.

```ts
import { createProposalToolkit } from "@qubiq/sdk";

const proposals = createProposalToolkit(liveClient);
const active = await proposals.listActive({ epoch: 190, limit: 5 });

console.log(proposals.summarize(active));
```

Available methods:

- `fetchCcf({ epoch, status })` – returns the raw `CcfProposalFetchResult` (active indices, finished indices, epoch metadata).
- `listActive({ epoch, limit })` – filters to currently active proposals.
- `listFinished({ epoch, limit })` – finished proposals.
- `describe(proposal)` – human readable `#index [status] ...` string.
- `summarize(list, { limit })` – map helper for dashboards or logs.

Use the toolkit when building governance dashboards or automation that needs to trigger jobs whenever a proposal changes state.

### Fetching finished proposals

```ts
const result = await proposals.fetchCcf({ status: "finished" });
result.proposals.forEach((proposal) => {
  console.log(proposals.describe(proposal));
});
```

The raw result includes `activeIndices`, `finishedIndices`, and `networkEpoch`, so you can correlate proposals with off-chain voting summaries or feed them into analytics.

Pair it with the automation event bus (`proposals.update` events) to cache the latest state without polling the API from every service.
