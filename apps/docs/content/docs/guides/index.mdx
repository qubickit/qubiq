# Guided paths

Use these opinionated guides to get productive quickly. Each one strings together the relevant `@qubiq/core` and `@qubiq/sdk` modules so you always know which docs to visit next.

- [Wallet Service](/guides/wallet-service) – expose wallet APIs, secure seeds, and stream balances.
- [Automation Pipeline](/guides/automation-pipeline) – ship monitoring, Prometheus metrics, and alerting.
- [Governance Dashboard](/guides/governance-dashboard) – fetch CCF proposals, render summaries, and automate follow-ups.

> Prefer à la carte docs? Jump back to [/core](/core) or [/sdk](/sdk) anytime.
