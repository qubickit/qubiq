title: Proto Reference
description: Use the extended live_service.proto as the source of truth for all HTTP clients today—and future gRPC endpoints once they open up.

## Proto location

`proto/qubic/live_service.proto` consolidates:

- Live service (tick info, block height, balances, broadcast, contract query).
- Assets (issuances, ownerships, possessions, identity asset lists, owners).
- Stats API (latest data, rich list).
- Query service (transactions, tick data, computor lists, processed intervals).
- Archive service (health/status, tick snapshots, identity transfers).

We mirror the swagger specs published under `https://qubic.github.io/integration/Partners/swagger/` so the file stays compatible with the HTTP API.

## Status of gRPC access

At the moment the public Qubic infrastructure exposes only HTTP endpoints. The proto exists for self-hosted nodes and future gRPC access, but `LiveServiceGrpcClient` ships disabled so the package doesn’t imply a working public endpoint prematurely.

If you run your own node, you can generate stubs like this:

```bash
npx protoc --ts_out=grpc_js:./generated --grpc_out=grpc_js:./generated \
  proto/qubic/live_service.proto
```

Then wire them into whatever language/runtime you need.

## HTTP parity

Every HTTP method implemented by `LiveServiceClient`, `QueryServiceClient`, and `ArchiveClient` maps directly to a proto definition. Treat the proto as the canonical schema even when you stay on HTTP—it’s the same data model.

## Roadmap

- ✅ HTTP clients + Zod validation (current release).
- 💤 gRPC helpers disabled until Qubic opens the port.
- 🚧 Examples/docs will be updated once the public endpoint lands.

Until then, focus on the HTTP clients, automation runtime, and examples showcased throughout the docs.
