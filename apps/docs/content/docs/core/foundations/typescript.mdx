description: How to run @qubiq/core locally, explore examples, and extend the toolkit.
---

This project is designed to feel great in everyday workflows—Bun for scripts/tests, Fumadocs for docs, and a set of runnable examples that mirror the guides on [core.qubickit.dev](https://core.qubickit.dev).

## Local setup

```bash
bun install
bun run lint
bun test
```

Use the same commands inside `apps/docs/` to work on the documentation site:

```bash
cd apps/docs
bun install
bun dev
```

Fumadocs hot-reloads MDX+React, so you can update guides and see the result instantly at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Examples directory

`examples/` mirrors the walkthroughs in the docs. A few highlights:

| Script | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `bun run example:watch --identity=SUZ...` | Streams balance changes using `WalletWatcher`. |
| `bun run example:send <seed> <dst> <amount>` | Derives keys, signs a transfer, and optionally broadcasts via the HTTP client. |
| `bun run example:automation --profile=mainnet` | Boots the automation runtime with watchers + proposal polling. |
| `bun run example:proposals` | Uses `ProposalCoordinator` to fetch and format CCF proposals. |

Examples accept `--help` to show flags. Environment variables (`QUBIC_SEED`, `QUBIC_LIVE_URL`, `QUBIC_AUTOMATION_IDENTITIES`) let you run them headlessly in CI or cron jobs.

## Testing & debugging

- `bun test` runs the entire suite (unit + integration). Live smoke tests stay skipped unless `QUBIC_SMOKE_TESTS=true`.
- `bun test path/to/file.test.ts` focuses on a single area—handy for wallet or interop work.
- `bun run lint` type-checks + Biome formats everything.

Running a self-hosted node and experimenting with gRPC? See `tests/interop/grpc-live-service.test.ts` for a fully in-process mock server you can adapt—public RPCs remain HTTP-only.

## Recommended workflow

1. Start the docs site (`bun dev` in `apps/docs/`).
2. Keep `bun test --watch` running for tight feedback.
3. Use `examples/` as scratchpads when building new guides. Once an example is stable, reference it from the docs.

That’s it—the rest of the docs dive into modules like wallets, automation, interop, and monitoring, all available at [core.qubickit.dev](https://core.qubickit.dev).
